## Assignment 3

I think that being able to remember how to type out the correct sequences to embed items is going to take a bit of time for me. Using # to make headings and making things **bold** and *italic* is pretty straightforward, but remembering where the right place to put a / or a . to link an image, for example, will take some time. An easy reference cheat sheet might help.

### Cheat Sheet

- *italic* (1 asterisk bookending the word)
- **bold** (2 asterisk bookending the word)
- Headline 1 (# before the word)
- Headline 2 (## before the word)
- Headline 3 (### before the word) and so on...
