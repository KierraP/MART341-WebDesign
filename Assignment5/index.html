<hr />
<h2> Idea 1 </h2>
<p>A portfolio for my illustrations and other art. I also want to eventually be able to use my site to sell art, so it should be simple and straightforward. I want the website to have a dark, sleek look, using black, white, & red to match my business cards.</p>

<h2> Idea 2 </h2>
<p>A website to host my webcomic. The site would match the aesthetic of the comic, which is sort of a sci-fi/steampunk/fantasy soup. Copper, pink, and blue are recurring colors. I'd also like to include bonus information about the world, the characters, and behind the scenes sketches. </p>

<h2> Idea 3 </h2>
<p>A website for my grandma's flower shop. Our business cards have a sunflower motif that I drew, so I think that should be incorporated in the site's design. The website's purpose would be to present customers with images of floral arrangements they can order. It should be professional and straightforward to use. <br /> Below is the sunflower I mentioned, linked from my website.<br /> </p>
