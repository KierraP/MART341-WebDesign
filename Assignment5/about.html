<h1> Assignment 5: About</h1>

<h2>Idea 1: Illustration Portfolio</h2>
<p> I already have an illustration portfolio website that I made using Wix. Wix isn't the easiest to use sometimes (at least for me), so if I can make the site myself, I can have more control. I also have to pay yearly for Wix, so making the site myself will also save me money.</p>

<h2>Idea 2: Webcomic Site</h2>
<p> Until I can have the resources to make a physical book, I want to make my comic available as a webcomic. Making the site myself means I can have more control about how my comic is presented, and I can include bonus information about my worlbuilding and characters that I would be unable to do on a webcomic site, such as Webtoon.</p>

<h2>Idea 3: Flower Shop Site</h2>
<p> I work at my grandma's flower shop, and I've been wanting to get a website going for a while. I have to explain to customers fairly regularly that we don't have a website, and I don't want to do that anymore. Having our own site will give customers an online catalog they can order from with ease.</p>
