I have chosen to develop the website for my grandma's flower shop. I think it is the most time sensitive of my choices, because just this week I had someone wanting to see what flowers we offer, and I didn't have a website to direct them to. If I could get a site up and running soon, it would really help.

The website actually came together a lot faster than I expected. Obviously, it's not finished, but putting together the basic elements was pretty easy. I used the color scheme that is on our business cards, and found it was pretty simple to do. I struggled the most with figuring out alignments. I was able to get my text elements on the left margin somewhat balanced out by putting my Sunflower logo on the right, but I think I can make it better in the future. I'm also looking forward to playing with fonts more.
